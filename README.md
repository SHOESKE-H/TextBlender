# TextBlender

## About
TextBlender obfuscates / minifies a given piece of text.

## Usage
No at the time. Once the ability to minify plaintext is added, this tab will get updated. ("coming soon! already got something cooked up, not yet commited...", me 8 months ago)

## Support
TextBlender hopes to support blending the following in the future:
- [ ] Plaintext (current priority)
- [ ] C / C++
- [ ] HTML/CSS
- [ ] Markup

## Motivation
Partly fun, partly since it'll make it easier to obfuscate my C code.
