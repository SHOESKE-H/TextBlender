# TextBlender

## About
A text minifier still well under development.

## Usage
No at the time. Once the ability to minify plaintext is added, this tab will get updated. (coming soon! already got something cooked up, not yet commited...)

## Support
TextBlender hopes to support blending the following in the future:
- [ ] Plaintext (current priority)
- [ ] C / C++
- [ ] HTML/CSS
- [ ] JS
- [ ] Markup

Some of the more obscure:
- [ ] Brainfuck
- [ ] Chef
- [ ] Whitespace

## Motivation
I've got a pretty slow internet connection, so when I hit F12 on websites, all I can think about is how much faster the loading times would be if the HTML and CSS were also minified like the JS. Sure, the assets take the longest to load, but when it comes to my attention span, there's no time to spare.

This project aims to take care of that. 

Then, in development, I noticed how dynamic everything was and the simplicity of adding another text type, so I thought it would be a waste only to use this for HTML and CSS specifically. That's why I hope to add support for other text types as well in the future.
